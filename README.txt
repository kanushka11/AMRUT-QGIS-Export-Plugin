# Sankalan 2.0 Data Transfer Plugin

## Overview

Sankalan 2.0 is a powerful data transfer plugin designed for seamless integration with QGIS. Developed by IIRS under ISRO, this plugin facilitates efficient data exchange and management, ensuring smooth workflows for geospatial applications. The main purpose of this plugin is to transfer data from a QGIS project to the Sankalan Mobile App to vet attributes on the ground. Target users are planning and administrative bodies under the AMRUT 2.0 Scheme of the Ministry of Urban and Housing Affairs.

## Features

- **Data Transfer for Mobile App**: Enables exporting of geospatial data to the Sankalan Mobile App.
- **Layer Validation and Clipping**: Includes features for validating grid layers and clipping data.
- **Seamless Integration**: Works natively within QGIS.
- **Efficient Workflow**: Ensures data integrity and consistency for AMRUT 2.0 workflows.

## System Requirements

- Minimum QGIS Version: 3.0
- QGIS Core Plugin: Processing
- Supported Operating Systems: Windows and Linux
